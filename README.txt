How to Play:
Defeat alien enemies to earn money and experience points. 
Money can be used to buy consumable items and stronger weapons. 
Use stronger weapons to face harder enemies the further you explore. 
Defeat the alien mothership boss at the end of the game world to win.
Try to win the game before the poison gas covers the entire world, as the poison gas will damage you every second you spend in it. The gas will take 10 minutes to cover the entire world.
